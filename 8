//The following code is a very simple example of delegates
//A delegate allows us to specify what the function we're calling looks like wthout having to specify which function to call
//The code was pulled from https://www.akadia.com/services/dotnet_delegates_and_events.html

/*
 output
 I was called by delegate ...
